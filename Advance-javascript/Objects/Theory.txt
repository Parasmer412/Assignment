
(Q-1 ): What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays?
  
  object =>

 > An object is a collection of properties, where each property is a key–value pair.

 > Keys (also called properties) are usually strings, and values can be any data type (string, number, array, another object, function, etc.).
  
 > Objects are used to represent real-world entities (like a person, car, or product) with attributes and behaviors.

    Feature                                 Objects                                                                  Arrays                                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure     | Stores data as **key–value pairs**                                           | Stores data as **indexed list** (ordered)                              |
| Access        | Accessed using keys (obj.key or obj["key"])                              | Accessed using index (`arr[0]`, `arr[1]`)                              |
| Order         | Properties are **not guaranteed in order**                                   | Elements are **ordered by index**                                      |
| Use Case      | Best for representing entities with attributes (e.g., person with name, age) | Best for ordered collections or lists of items (e.g., numbers, fruits) |

  (Q-2) : Explain how to access and update object properties using dot notation and bracket notation.?

   => Accessing & Updating Object Properties in JavaScript

    > An object stores data as key–value pairs.
    > You can access or update these properties in two ways:
     
    > 1. Dot Notation (object.key)
     
    > Simple and commonly used.
     
    > Works when the property name is a valid identifier (no spaces, special characters, or starting with a number).
     
   => 2. Bracket Notation (object["key"])

    > Property name is written as a string inside brackets.
     
    > Useful when:
     
    > Property names have spaces or special characters.
     
    > Property name is stored in a variable.
