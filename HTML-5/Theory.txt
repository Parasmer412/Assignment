  > Includes new form controls like date, email, number, range, etc.
   
  > Supports Canvas (<canvas>) and SVG for drawing graphics, animations, and games.
   
  > Geolocation API, Web Storage, WebSockets, and offline support (Application Cache / Service     Workers).
   
  > Designed to work better with mobile and responsive design.
   
  > More lenient error handling than older HTML.
