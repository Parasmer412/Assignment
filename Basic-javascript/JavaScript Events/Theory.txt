(Q-1) : What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners.

=>  Events :


>  In JavaScript, an event is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, often triggered by the user or the browser itself.

=> Examples:

  > Clicking a button (onclick)

  > Typing in a textbox (oninput)

  > Loading a webpage (onload)

  > Moving the mouse (onmousemove)

>  Events allow you to make web pages interactive and dynamic.

=> Role of Event Listeners

> An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur, then executes some code in response.

> Instead of embedding event handling directly in HTML, you can attach event listeners using JavaScript.

> This separates structure (HTML) from behavior (JS) and makes code more modular.

(Q-2) :  How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an example.

  
 => How addEventListener() Works

  > addEventListener() is a method in JavaScript used to attach an event handler to an element.

  > It lets you run some code when a specific event (like click, keypress, or mouseover) occurs.

  > Unlike inline events (onclick="..."), it keeps HTML and JS separate and allows multiple event listeners on the same element.

 
 => Syntax : element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);


  > element → The HTML element you want to attach the listener to.

  > event → Type of event (like "click", "mouseover", "keydown").

  > function → The code (function) to execute when the event happens.

  > useCapture (optional) → true or false, determines event flow (default: false).


  => Example : 


                 <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
              <title>addEventListener Example</title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <button id="myBtn">Click Me</button>
            
              <script>
                // Select button
                let button = document.getElementById("myBtn");
            
                // Attach event listener
                button.addEventListener("click", function() {
                  alert("Button was clicked!");
                });
              </script>
            </body>
            </html>
