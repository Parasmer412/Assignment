(Q-1) : Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide abasic
        example of each.

 =>  1. For loop

    >   Best used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat the code.
       
    >   Structure: for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {}

      Example:

       for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            console.log("For loop count: " + i);
             }

  
  => 2. while loop

      >  Used when you donâ€™t know the exact number of iterations in advance.
        
      >  Runs as long as the condition is true.

     Example:

          let i = 1;
          while (i <= 5) {
                console.log("While loop count: " + i);
                i++;
         }


  => 3. do-while loop

    > Similar to while, but always runs at least once (because the condition is checked after the       code runs).

 Example:

             let i = 1;
             do {
                 console.log("Do-While loop count: " + i);
                 i++;
             } while (i <= 5);

 (Q-2)  : What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop ?
 
   =>  While Loop

    > Condition is checked first, before running the block.
     
    > If the condition is false at the start, the loop body will not run at all.

 Example:
      
       let x = 5;

        while (x < 5) {
            console.log("This is while loop example"); /* this example is not run becouse this is false */
        }
        
    > Here, nothing is printed because the condition is false at the beginning.

 
  => Do-While-Loop 

    > Code runs first, then the condition is checked.

    > Guarantees the loop body runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

Example:
        let x = 5;

         do {
             console.log("This will run once, even though condition is false");
         } while (x < 5);
